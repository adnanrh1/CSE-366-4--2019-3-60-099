This project aimed to predict heart disease using machine learning. We used a dataset from Kaggle and implemented four classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest Classification. The data was preprocessed and split into training and testing sets. Each algorithm was trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Our findings provided insights into heart disease prediction and the effectiveness of various classification algorithms. This project not only enhanced our understanding of machine learning for heart disease prediction but also offered valuable experience in implementing classification algorithms, preprocessing and analyzing datasets, utilizing data visualization techniques, and working with the Kaggle platform. Based on the evaluation metrics and confusion matrices, we identified the best-performing algorithm for heart disease prediction within this dataset and analyzed its strengths and weaknesses. This project has equipped us with a comprehensive understanding of machine learning for heart disease prediction and the factors influencing its effectiveness.
